**Ans:** **Your code calls a library. A framework calls your code.**<br> 
A library is just a collection of functions or class definitions that you can call. Each call does some work and returns control to the client.
The reason behind is simply code reuse, i.e. get the code that has already been written by other developers. The classes or functions normally define specific operations in a domain specific area. For example, there are some libraries of mathematics which can let developer just call the function without redo the implementation of how an algorithm works.

**Framework is a collection of various libraries**, A framework embodies some abstract design, with more behavior built in. In order to use it you need to insert your behavior into various places in the framework either by subclassing or by plugging in your own classes. The framework's code then calls your code at these points.
